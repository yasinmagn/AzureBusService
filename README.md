# Azure Service Bus Messaging Services

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of various Azure messaging services, including Event Grid, Event Hub, Storage Queues, and Service Bus, for enterprise order processing and other high-value messaging systems.

## Messaging Services

### 1. Event Grid
- Best suited for reactive programming scenarios such as database triggers.

### 2. Event Hub
- Ideal for big data pipelines and event streaming, ensuring no data is missed.

### 3. Storage Queues
- Basic queue storage that can grow beyond 80 GB.

### 4. Service Bus
- **High-value enterprise messaging**: Suitable for order processing, financial transactions, and more.
- **Features**:
  - Supports publish/subscribe, topics, and queues.
  - Can grow up to 80 GB.
  - Guarantees FIFO (First In, First Out) order.
  - Supports duplicate detection.
  - Uses the AMQP protocol.
  
#### Queues
- **Functionality**: Stores messages until the receiving application is available to process them.
- **Temporary Storage**: Messages are delivered in pull mode.
- **Scalability**: Add or remove receiver instances as needed based on queue length and workload.

#### Topics
- Similar to queues but with multiple subscriptions, allowing for more complex message distribution scenarios.

## Sample POST Body for Order Creation

```json
{
  "orderId": 0,
  "customerName": "John Doe",
